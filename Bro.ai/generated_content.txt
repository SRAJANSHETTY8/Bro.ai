Dear Srajan,

I've got a solution for you to calculate Fibonacci numbers in Java. You can use a simple recursive function or a more efficient iterative approach. 

In the recursive method, you'll define a function that calls itself with decreasing values until it reaches the base case (usually 0 or 1), at which point it starts returning values back up the call stack. 

Alternatively, you can use a loop to iteratively calculate each Fibonacci number, storing previous values to calculate the next one. This approach is usually more efficient and avoids the risk of stack overflow.

Either way, you'll end up with a function that takes an integer as input (the position of the Fibonacci number you want) and returns the corresponding value.

Let me know if you need more details or the actual code implementation!

Best,
Syrus
